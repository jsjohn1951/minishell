Test for invalid characters plz

cd - -> segfault

cd into a directory -> delete the directory -> cd .. -> OLDPWD is gonna be empty

ctrl + c inside minishell inside minishell displays double prompt -> it's up to you if u wanna handle it

(ctrl + c && ctrl + d) are not woking inside heredoc

./minishell | ./minishell | ./minishell -> it's working but the prompt isn't working (not showing the cmd I'm writing)
