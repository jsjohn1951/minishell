Test for invalid characters plz

cd - -> segfault

signals exit code (ctrl + c);

redirection permissions -> executes cmd if the file have 0 permissions
			chmod 0 test.txt
			echo hi > test.txt

echo -n "args" redirection -> it doesn't redirect

echo -n hi | cat -e -> pipe doesn't work

cd into a directory -> delete the directory -> cd .. -> OLDPWD is gonna be empty

ctrl + c inside minishell inside minishell displays double prompt -> it's up to you if u wanna handle it

(ctrl + c && ctrl + d) are not woking inside heredoc

ls |      -> should be an error (open pipe)

./minishell | ./minishell | ./minishell -> it's working but the prompt isn't working (not showing the cmd I'm writing)
